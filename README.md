# GZDoom-VR 
Based on gz3doom (http://rotatingpenguin.com/gz3doom/) and OpenVr Doom https://github.com/Fishbiter/gz3doom.
The aim of this fork is to update base GZDoom version.

Built/tested on Oculus Quest and ALVR but other VR setups should work.

This build exposes OpenVR controller input for definition (you will need to define the controls).

One hand (right by default) is tracked for the weapon. I have included two modified weapon packs authored by Fishbiter. 

You could also try an HD weapon pack made by ajantaju https://github.com/hh79/gz3doom/files/4378108/HDVRweapons.zip or a weapon pack made for Brutal Doom https://github.com/ajantaju/br_vr

# Not done

No comfort options/teleporting etc. I am not intend to implement these.

# New console variables

openvr_rightHanded - set to 0 for left hand

openvr_weaponRotate - A pitch to change how weapons sit in the hand.

openvr_scale - Number of doom units in a metre. The default is 30.
